We used an Arduino board with an MPU 650 sensor along with an SD card module.
The whole setup was attached to a baseball hat and was tested by an individual, then we plotted the results using Matlab.
Furthermore, using the KNN method from supervised machine learning we trained a model to discriminate each different mode of movement.
Every file is available in a ZIP file, Codes are also available separately out of the compressed file.
