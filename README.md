Here you will be able to find all the files related to a complete project. 
The project is mainly designed to detect and discriminate different kinds of motion in a human being such as staticly standing, running, jumping and... . 
We used a arduino board with MPU 650 sensor along with a SD card module.
The whole setup was attached to a baseball hat and was tested by an individual, then we plotted the results using matlab.
Furthermore, using KNN method from supervised machine learning we trained a model to discriminate each different mode of movement.
Every file is available in ZIP file, Codes are also available seperately out of the compressed file.
